There are eclipse project and class files here but they use my own library project that 
includes all the dependencies.  I have not included the dependencies but if you build
with maven they will all be downloaded automatically.

To compile and run the unit tests
	mvn compile

There is also a java application that you can launch via
	mvn exec:java

These libraries were used
	google guice -	for dependency injection (version 4.0)
	slf4j        -  for logging (version 1.7.30) 
	junit        -  unit test framework (version 4.13)
